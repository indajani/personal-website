      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a stay at home highschool senior on my way to applying to a bunch
        of colleges. I have always had a love for all things creative. Whether
        it is drawing or poetry, I am always open to exploring new ways to
        express herself. My poem “Title TBD” was highlighted in the Saratoga
        Performing Arts Center Festival of Young Artists Poetry Slam. I am an
        editor for my School’s Literary Magazine, and loves to free write.
        Beyond writing, I enjoy to figure draw (many of her drawings pepper this
        blog), from images and my favorite TV shows. I am an aspiring violin and
        flute player. Playing with the Empire State Youth Orchestra in the
        2019-2020 season on the violin and being accepted into the program this
        year on the flute. I am also an amatuer coder as this website is my
        first foray into coding.

    <h3>I am...</h3>
    <div class="aboutme">
      <h4>A writer</h4>
      <p>
        I like to take the craziness that comes with everyday life and make
        something special out of it. You can find all my random thoughts and
        musings under my blog section.

    <div class="aboutme">
      <h4>An Artist</h4>
      <p>
        Art was something that I had never really taken seriously before. I had
        taken a few classes in highschool but always felt bored by their
        content. Ever since I had to drop art, I have been taking the initiative
        to study on my own time. I enjoy figure drawing but I am looking to
        expand my horizons and develop a more stylized visual style. Someday I
        wish to be able to create artwork that can tell a compelling story
        through characters, settings and composition. For now, you can follow my
        art journey in the portfolio tag.

      <h4>A Coder</h4>
      <p>
        After finding myself practically homeschooled due to the sudden Covid 19
        outbreak I took on the Girl's Who Code 1 week coding course where I had
        to build my own personal website. I am still a novice at this so much
        more work needs to be done before this place looks anywhere near
        complete.
